Education of any kind helps build confidence along with self-improvement. Once that feeling of success is felt by the inmate they will be more apt to want to continue to work towards their education and rehabilitation. </p>

Education can reduce recidivism. A study done by Journal of Experimental Criminology in 2018 found that inamtes who enroll in education programs are 48% less likely to be reincarcerated than their peers who do not.</p>
